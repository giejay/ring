**Please Note**: Live streaming issues are extremely difficult to diagnose and reproduce.  If you have followed all of the advice in the wiki and still have issues, there is likely nothing that I can do for you.  Please only open an issue if you have a deep understanding of the network issue and have an actual suggestion for how to fix it.
